# What is Hyperion?

Hyperion is a discord.js v14 framework that aims to help developers create bots efficiently.

# Why Hyperion?

Hyperion offers a myriad of features:

-   [x] **TypeScript** (yay!)

    Hyperion is written in strong and super strict TypeScript for code safety and resilience and that you won't be 
    making any silly mistakes. TypeScript is also a joy to work with! You should use it too.

-   [x] **Qwik-N-EZ Interactions**

    The initial setup for interactions is tiring. 
    Without a proper workflow, deploying your slash commands is tedious and kinda boring imo. Hyperion handles all that automagically!

-   [ ] **Database Support**
    Prisma?

-   [ ] **Logging, Logging, Logging**
    
    Still deciding the logger lol

-   [ ] **Utilisable Utilities**

    Hyperion provides a set of utilities out of the box. Use the handy `Time.hours()` to convert hours to milliseconds. 
    Increase your WPM with convenient shorthands for creating components like embeds and select menus. 
    Did I mention Hyperion comes with paginated embeds?

# Why was Hyperion made?

The slow and repetitive nature of copy-pasting code between my Discord bots was getting old _quick_. Hence, I decided to create a framework that would provide a common set of utilities and features that I could use across all my bots, while at the same time being as flexible as possible.

# Is Hyperion production-ready?

No. This was written as a solo project with a large amount of testing, but bugs could still slip through every now and then. I don't think it's ready for bots that have a large amount of users across hundreds of guilds, but it should be fine for smaller ones.

Sharding is also **NOT supported** at the moment, as I haven't done a ton of research on it.

# FAQs (?)

## Why didn't you just use an existing framework, like Sapphire or Akairo?

cuz coding is cool and i like to reinvent the wheel

## Why "Hyperion"?

'Hyperion' is the name of a sword in the Skyblock gamemode on the Hypixel Minecraft server. It's one of the most powerful swords in there, and I thought this framework would be fitting for that title. Also, it's a very cool name.
